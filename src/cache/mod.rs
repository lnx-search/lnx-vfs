/// data (i.e. no metadata, no structure overhead, etc...) and stores each block contiguously
/// allowing the system to return contiguous blocks of memory on reads without additional copies.

/// The caching strategy used is a LFU (Least Frequently Used) policy provided by `moka`.
/// The system itself may not immediately free memory when it has been marked for eviction
/// due to reads holding a reference to the memory currently, therefore, it is recommended
/// to allow some buffer zone of memory allowance as the system is not guaranteed to stay
/// within the bounds set constantly.
